NOTE:
There should be three branches in GitHub when you are complete. Branching is an important concept
that is worth the time to learn. You have seen several demos of my branches and how easy it is to
preserve the state of the source code and easy it is to navigate between branches. Get active on
Piazza if you do not understand the branching part. Remember, you can also do all this on the
command line that is available in Android Studio.
